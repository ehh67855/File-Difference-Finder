/To clean my code (i.e., remove any compiled files), type:

$ make clean

Why are the times different for steps 1 and 2?

I have found that when dealing with smaller file lengths,
step one takes longer then step 2. When dealing with larger file
lengths however, step 2 takes much longer then step
2. One plausible explanation for this is that step one only
traverses the file once whereas step two parses the file
using seek to get the size of the file, and then
parses the file again to copy the file into an array.
This extra step of parsing done in step two likly takes
a very small amount of time for small file sizes, and
because the data is then inside of arrays, the
comparison operations take very little time to execute.
However if the file size is much greater, step two
would take longer because it has to parse the file
more times then in step one. As a result step one would
take a shorter amount of time for larger files because it
does not need to parse the file as many times as in step 1.
